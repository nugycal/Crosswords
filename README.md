# Crosswords

## Description

Having just spent quite some time completing the crosswords offered at [regex crosswords](https://regexcrossword.com/), I was very disappointed to find a lack of any other services online which offered a similar challenge. Therefore, I opted to attempt to create a similar service myself.

This webpage is built using new technologies such as flexbox and CSS grids to make it responsive (the user interface changes to adapt to different screen sizes).
I also hope to utilise a more modular approach towards the JS component of the site, which is an improvement upon my existing method.

## Goals

* ~Responsive Design using Modern CSS Technologies~
* Generate a fixed-size crossword using a given word list of 20+ words of varying length
* Generate a variable-size crossword using a given word list of 10+ words of varying length
* Implement reload functionality
* Implement 'sharing' functionality
* Implement zooming of the crossword to allow for optimal user experience on smaller devices (possibly using a slider with multiple zoom levels in a bottom corner (like Google Maps))
